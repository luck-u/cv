        link: "#"
        tagline: "This model is built in paperspace and i have used a pre-trained model, that is, a model created by some one else to solve a different problem. Instead of building a model from scratch to solve a similar problem, we'll use a model trained on ImageNet (1.2 million images and 1000 classes) as a starting point. The model is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), a type of Neural Network that builds state-of-the-art models for computer vision.I have used the resnet34 model. resnet34 is a version of the model that won the 2015 ImageNet competition.I have train and evalulate a baseball vs cricket model in 3 lines of code."
